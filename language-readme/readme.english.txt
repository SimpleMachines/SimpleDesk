Thank you for downloading SimpleDesk :)

[b]License[/b]

Yes, we know, you don't want the boring formality of a license, but to protect us - and you - we have a license in the code. Clicking the install button after this constitutes acceptance of the following terms.

Loosely translated (and this bit isn't the legal wording)
* You can pass it on to others but you have to leave the copyright in the files, including derived/modified versions

* You can't use the name of SimpleDesk to promote something without asking us first.


[b]So, what next?[/b]

Well, once you click the button and install this mod, the installer will take you to the Core Features page of the SMF admin panel, where you can enable SimpleDesk and begin working with it.

[b]What if I need help?[/b]

You can always get help on our forum, http://www.simpledesk.net/community/

When SimpleDesk is installed, there will be an extra area for support in the SimpleDesk admin area, that will take you to our forum and help you make a post in the best place for your question - and provide us with some necessary information at the same time.


I think that's everything from us for now! Enjoy using SimpleDesk as much as we enjoyed creating it!
